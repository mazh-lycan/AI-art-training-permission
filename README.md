# Registration of Artwork hash for explicit and public consent for AI-training 

This project aims to protect the intellectual property of artists against the use of their artworks without consent with the purpose of training AI models.

The project aims to provide a public registry of consent over images and a link with the original artists. This will allow:
- To check if an artist has given consent over an image to allow for AI training.
- To facilitate to the AI creators to provide incentives in exchange to the artists that give consent via the information logged in the registry.


0xA710536b170E29F701636AEf82d32F4864140f5C is the current Smart Contract used by the project on Sepolia.
Please take into account that this is an unfinished demo of the final product. Registration of accounts to protect rights does not provide a solid legal proof in the current state of the project.
